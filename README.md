## Getting Started

[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, and all major frameworks. 

With TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can run Flutter tests on real devices in the cloud. This sample shows how to configure a Flutter application to run tests on the TestMu AI real device cloud.

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [TestMu AI Documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) for the full setup walkthrough.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- A TestMu AI account. [Sign up for free](https://www.testmuai.com/register/).
- TestMu AI `Username` and `Access Key` from the [TestMu AI Automation Dashboard](https://automation.testmuai.com/).

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/flutter-sample
cd flutter-sample
```

Install Flutter dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Set your TestMu AI credentials as environment variables:

For **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

For **Windows**:
```powershell
$env:LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
$env:LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Run tests

Run Flutter tests locally:

```bash
flutter test
```

To run on the TestMu AI real device cloud, build and upload your Flutter app, then configure Appium capabilities to point to the TestMu AI grid. See the [TestMu AI Appium documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/appium-setup-with-lambdatest-automation/) for details.

### Local testing with TestMu AI Tunnel

To test locally hosted apps, set up the TestMu AI tunnel. OS-specific guides:

- [Local Testing on Windows](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-windows/)
- [Local Testing on macOS](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-macos/)
- [Local Testing on Linux](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-linux/)

Enable tunnel in your Appium capabilities:

```json
{
  "tunnel": true
}
```

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
